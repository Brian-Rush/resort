    <h2>Experience DB Resort</h2>
    <p>
    At the quiet end of an idyllic cove, this cottage colony was utterly remade by master minimalist Christian Liaigre. The decor is elaborately spare—bare white walls, dark wood floors, and nary a rounded edge or flourish in sight—but with no sacrifice to comfort. The 39 rooms have buttery linens and walled gardens with giant daybeds (Grand Suites add settees and bathtubs), and cushioned banquettes make up most of the restaurant’s seating.
    </p>
    DB Resort exceeds expectations by both capturing the spirit and energy of the island and creating a welcoming environment that makes each and every visitor feel as though they have found a second home.
